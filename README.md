# `latin-text-model`

Specification and implementation of a model for editions of texts in Latin.

This library is closely modelled on  the Homer Multitext text model (see the [hmt-textmodel repository](https://github.com/homermultitext/hmt-textmodel). Like the HMT text model, it supports working with the text contents of citable nodes as a sequence of tokens with specified properties.
