# HC MID Latin text model

This library implements a model of a citable passage of text as a sequence of semantic tokens.  Each token has a rich set of properties identified by [HC MID projects](https://hcmid.github.io/) in their documented diplomatic editions.

HC MID projects encode their archival editions in XML markup following [TEI guidelines](http://www.tei-c.org/).  The `latinmodel` library includes a `LatinTeiReader` object that can read TEI markup following HC MID conventions.  (For now, see the notes on XML markup from HC MID's Pliny project, on [their project wiki](https://github.com/HCMID/plinius/wiki/XML-Markup-Explanation).)
